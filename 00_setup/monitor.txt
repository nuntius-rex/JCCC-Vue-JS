The book, View.js Basic Concepts recommends Simple Hot Reload Server.

However, this tool does not run on some operating systems.

Here is an example of how to do the same with Nodemon and Reload:

Note: The following script will need to be added to each example as needed:

<script src="/reload/reload.js"></script>

See template 01_browser-templates/2c_template.html for usage along with Node JS.
