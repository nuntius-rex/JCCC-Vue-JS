The following are simple starter templates for browser only Vue.js.

1.) Basic.html is a simple explanation.
2.) 2A matches the book Vue.js Basic Concepts default
3.) 2B is the same as the above, but with a query reference instead of document.getElementById
4.) 2C is for usage with "nodemon reload" when serving from Node. Which will refresh HTML changes on load.
